<h2>Understanding Stroke and Its Effects</h2>

<h3>Types of Stroke</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ischemic stroke:</strong> Caused by a blood clot blocking blood flow to the brain (about 87% of strokes)</li>
  <li><strong>Hemorrhagic stroke:</strong> Caused by bleeding in or around the brain</li>
  <li><strong>Transient ischemic attack (TIA):</strong> "Mini-stroke" with temporary symptoms—a warning sign of future stroke</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Effects of Stroke</h3>
<p>Stroke effects depend on which part of the brain was damaged and how severely:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Paralysis or weakness:</strong> Often on one side of the body (hemiplegia/hemiparesis)</li>
  <li><strong>Speech and language problems:</strong> Difficulty speaking, understanding, reading, or writing (aphasia)</li>
  <li><strong>Cognitive changes:</strong> Memory problems, difficulty thinking, poor judgment</li>
  <li><strong>Emotional changes:</strong> Depression, anxiety, mood swings, personality changes</li>
  <li><strong>Vision problems:</strong> Loss of vision in one eye or on one side</li>
  <li><strong>Swallowing difficulties:</strong> Dysphagia, which increases choking and aspiration risk</li>
  <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Overwhelming exhaustion that's common after stroke</li>
  <li><strong>Sensory changes:</strong> Numbness, tingling, or pain</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Principle: Neuroplasticity</h3>
<p>The brain can reorganize and form new connections to compensate for damage. This "neuroplasticity" is greatest in the first months after stroke but continues throughout life. Intensive, repetitive practice helps the brain rewire itself.</p>

<h2>Rehabilitation at Home</h2>

<h3>Working with the Therapy Team</h3>
<p>After discharge, rehabilitation may continue through:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Home health therapy:</strong> Therapists come to your home</li>
  <li><strong>Outpatient therapy:</strong> Regular visits to a rehabilitation center</li>
  <li><strong>Day rehabilitation programs:</strong> Intensive outpatient therapy</li>
</ul>

<p>Types of therapy often needed:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Physical therapy (PT):</strong> Mobility, strength, balance</li>
  <li><strong>Occupational therapy (OT):</strong> Daily living skills, adaptive equipment</li>
  <li><strong>Speech-language therapy:</strong> Communication, swallowing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Caregiver Role in Rehabilitation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Learn exercises from therapists and help practice between visits</li>
  <li>Encourage independence—let them struggle appropriately</li>
  <li>Maintain a consistent exercise schedule</li>
  <li>Track progress and report to the therapy team</li>
  <li>Celebrate small victories</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supporting Physical Recovery</h2>

<h3>Mobility and Walking</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Follow therapist instructions for assisted walking</li>
  <li>Use prescribed assistive devices (walker, cane, AFO brace)</li>
  <li>Clear pathways and remove fall hazards</li>
  <li>Install grab bars in bathroom and stairways</li>
  <li>Consider a stair lift if stairs are unavoidable</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preventing Falls</h3>
<p>Fall risk is significantly elevated after stroke. See our <a href="/articles/home-safety-checklist-seniors-fall-prevention">home safety checklist</a> for detailed modifications.</p>

<h3>Activities of Daily Living</h3>
<p>Occupational therapists teach techniques and provide adaptive equipment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One-handed dressing techniques</li>
  <li>Adaptive utensils for eating</li>
  <li>Shower benches and grab bars</li>
  <li>Button hooks and zipper pulls</li>
  <li>Rocker knives for one-handed cutting</li>
</ul>

  <figcaption>Home modifications improve safety and independence after stroke.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Communication Support</h2>

<h3>Understanding Aphasia</h3>
<p>Aphasia affects the ability to communicate but not intelligence. People with aphasia may have trouble with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finding the right words (expressive aphasia)</li>
  <li>Understanding spoken language (receptive aphasia)</li>
  <li>Reading and writing</li>
  <li>Using numbers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Communication Strategies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Speak slowly and clearly</li>
  <li>Use short, simple sentences</li>
  <li>Give extra time to respond—don't rush</li>
  <li>Ask yes/no questions when possible</li>
  <li>Use gestures, pictures, and writing to supplement</li>
  <li>Don't pretend to understand if you don't</li>
  <li>Treat them as an adult—aphasia is not a cognitive disability</li>
</ul>

<h2>Emotional and Psychological Care</h2>

<h3>Post-Stroke Depression</h3>
<p>Depression affects up to one-third of stroke survivors. Watch for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Persistent sadness or hopelessness</li>
  <li>Loss of interest in activities</li>
  <li>Changes in sleep or appetite</li>
  <li>Social withdrawal</li>
  <li>Statements of worthlessness</li>
</ul>
<p>Depression is treatable—report symptoms to the healthcare team.</p>

<h3>Emotional Lability</h3>
<p>Some stroke survivors experience sudden, uncontrollable crying or laughing that doesn't match their emotions. This is caused by brain damage, not emotional instability. Medications can help.</p>

<h2>Preventing Another Stroke</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Blood thinners, blood pressure medications, cholesterol medications—take as prescribed</li>
  <li><strong>Blood pressure control:</strong> The most important modifiable risk factor</li>
  <li><strong>Healthy diet:</strong> Low sodium, heart-healthy eating</li>
  <li><strong>No smoking:</strong> Quitting dramatically reduces risk</li>
  <li><strong>Regular exercise:</strong> As approved by doctor</li>
  <li><strong>Diabetes management:</strong> Keep blood sugar controlled</li>
  <li><strong>Limit alcohol:</strong> Per doctor's recommendations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Caregiver Self-Care</h2>
<p>Stroke caregiving is demanding. Protect yourself:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accept that recovery takes time—often years</li>
  <li>Use <a href="/respite-care/massachusetts">respite care</a> to take breaks</li>
  <li>Join a stroke caregiver support group</li>
  <li>Don't neglect your own health</li>
  <li>Set realistic expectations</li>
</ul>

      {
        question: "How long does stroke recovery take?",
        answer: "Stroke recovery is highly individual. The fastest improvement typically occurs in the first 3-6 months, but recovery can continue for years. Some people regain most function; others have lasting disabilities. Factors affecting recovery include stroke severity, location of brain damage, overall health, rehabilitation intensity, and family support."
      },
      {
        question: "Can someone fully recover from a stroke?",
        answer: "Some people do make a near-complete recovery, especially from minor strokes. Others have lasting effects. About 10% of stroke survivors recover almost completely, 25% recover with minor impairments, 40% have moderate to severe impairments requiring special care, 10% require long-term facility care, and 15% die shortly after the stroke."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the best way to help someone with aphasia communicate?",
        answer: "Be patient and give extra time. Use simple, short sentences. Ask yes/no questions when possible. Use gestures, pictures, or writing to supplement speech. Don't pretend to understand if you don't. Treat them as the intelligent adult they are—aphasia affects language, not intelligence. Speech-language therapy helps improve communication over time."
      },
      {
        question: "When should home care start after a stroke?",
        answer: "Home care can begin immediately upon discharge from the hospital or rehabilitation facility. Many families arrange care before discharge so support is in place from day one. Early support helps prevent falls, ensures medication adherence, and provides consistent rehabilitation practice between therapy sessions."

        question: "Is exercise good or bad for arthritis?",
        answer: "Exercise is essential for arthritis management. While rest is important during acute flare-ups, regular gentle exercise strengthens muscles that support joints, maintains flexibility, reduces pain, and helps control weight. Low-impact activities like walking, swimming, and tai chi are ideal. The saying 'motion is lotion' captures how movement helps joint lubrication."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis?",
        answer: "Osteoarthritis is 'wear and tear' arthritis from cartilage breakdown over time. It typically affects weight-bearing joints and develops gradually. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks joint tissue, causing inflammation. It often affects multiple joints symmetrically and can cause systemic symptoms like fatigue. Treatment approaches differ significantly."
      },
      {
        question: "When should someone with arthritis consider home care?",
        answer: "Consider home care when arthritis makes daily activities difficult or unsafe—when dressing takes too long, bathing becomes risky, meal preparation is challenging, or the home isn't being maintained. Even a few hours weekly can help with tasks that are painful or difficult while preserving independence for things still manageable."
      },
      {
        question: "Do weather changes really affect arthritis pain?",
        answer: "Many people with arthritis report that cold, damp, or changing weather worsens their pain. While scientific evidence is mixed, the experience is real for many. Barometric pressure changes may affect joint fluid and inflammation. If weather affects your loved one, plan for more support during challenging weather conditions."

<h2>Understanding COPD</h2>

<h3>What Is COPD?</h3>
<p>COPD is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. It includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Chronic bronchitis:</strong> Inflammation and narrowing of the airways with excess mucus production</li>
  <li><strong>Emphysema:</strong> Destruction of the air sacs (alveoli) where oxygen exchange occurs</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people with COPD have both conditions to varying degrees.</p>

<h3>Common Symptoms</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Shortness of breath, especially with activity</li>
  <li>Chronic cough (often called "smoker's cough")</li>
  <li>Excess mucus (sputum) production</li>
  <li>Wheezing</li>
  <li>Chest tightness</li>
  <li>Fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance</li>
  <li>Frequent respiratory infections</li>
  <li>Swelling in ankles, feet, or legs (advanced disease)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Medication Management</h2>

<h3>Types of COPD Medications</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bronchodilators:</strong> Relax muscles around airways (short-acting rescue and long-acting maintenance)</li>
  <li><strong>Inhaled corticosteroids:</strong> Reduce airway inflammation</li>
  <li><strong>Combination inhalers:</strong> Multiple medications in one device</li>
  <li><strong>Oral steroids:</strong> For flare-ups/exacerbations</li>
  <li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong> For respiratory infections</li>
  <li><strong>Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors:</strong> Reduce inflammation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proper Inhaler Use</h3>
<p>Many COPD patients don't use inhalers correctly, reducing effectiveness. Caregivers can help by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learning proper technique for each inhaler type</li>
  <li>Observing and correcting technique</li>
  <li>Ensuring spacers are used when prescribed</li>
  <li>Reminding about maintenance vs. rescue medications</li>
  <li>Tracking when medications are due for refill</li>
</ul>

<p>See our <a href="/articles/medication-management-seniors-safety-guide">medication management guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Oxygen Therapy</h2>

<h3>When Oxygen Is Needed</h3>
<p>Supplemental oxygen is prescribed when blood oxygen levels fall too low. It may be needed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Continuously (24 hours)</li>
  <li>During activity only</li>
  <li>During sleep only</li>
  <li>Or combination of the above</li>
</ul>

<h3>Oxygen Safety</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No smoking or open flames near oxygen:</strong> Oxygen doesn't explode but makes fires burn faster</li>
  <li><strong>Keep oxygen away from heat sources:</strong> Stoves, heaters, fireplaces</li>
  <li><strong>Don't use petroleum-based products:</strong> Use water-based lotions on face/nose</li>
  <li><strong>Store tanks properly:</strong> Secure upright, away from traffic areas</li>
  <li><strong>Have working smoke detectors:</strong> Throughout the home</li>
  <li><strong>Post "Oxygen in Use" signs:</strong> At entrances</li>
</ul>

<h3>Caregiver Oxygen Tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure adequate oxygen supply—don't run out</li>
  <li>Check that equipment is working properly</li>
  <li>Keep backup supplies for power outages</li>
  <li>Monitor that oxygen is worn as prescribed</li>
  <li>Watch for skin breakdown where tubing rests</li>
</ul>

  <figcaption>Proper oxygen use and safety are essential for COPD management.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Breathing Techniques</h2>

<h3>Pursed Lip Breathing</h3>
<p>This technique slows breathing and helps get more air out of the lungs:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Breathe in slowly through the nose (2 counts)</li>
  <li>Purse lips like you're going to blow out a candle</li>
  <li>Breathe out slowly through pursed lips (4 counts)</li>
  <li>Exhale twice as long as inhale</li>
</ol>

<h3>Diaphragmatic Breathing</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Sit or lie comfortably</li>
  <li>Place one hand on chest, one on stomach</li>
  <li>Breathe in through nose—stomach should rise, chest stay still</li>
  <li>Breathe out through pursed lips—stomach falls</li>
</ol>

<h3>Energy Conservation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sit for tasks when possible</li>
  <li>Use wheeled carts to move items</li>
  <li>Take rest breaks during activities</li>
  <li>Break tasks into smaller steps</li>
  <li>Breathe out during exertion (lifting, pushing)</li>
  <li>Organize home to minimize trips</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preventing Exacerbations (Flare-ups)</h2>

<h3>Common Triggers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Respiratory infections (colds, flu, pneumonia)</li>
  <li>Air pollution and poor air quality</li>
  <li>Cigarette smoke and secondhand smoke</li>
  <li>Cold or hot, humid weather</li>
  <li>Strong fumes (cleaning products, perfumes)</li>
  <li>Allergens (dust, pollen, pet dander)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prevention Strategies</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Vaccinations:</strong> Annual flu shot, pneumonia vaccines, COVID-19</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid sick people:</strong> Respiratory infections are dangerous</li>
  <li><strong>Hand hygiene:</strong> Frequent handwashing</li>
  <li><strong>No smoking:</strong> Absolute requirement—no exceptions</li>
  <li><strong>Air quality:</strong> Use air filters, avoid high pollution days</li>
  <li><strong>Stay active:</strong> Pulmonary rehabilitation exercises</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recognizing Emergencies</h2>

<h3>Warning Signs</h3>
<p>Seek immediate medical care for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Severe shortness of breath that doesn't improve with medication</li>
  <li>Blue or gray lips or fingernails (cyanosis)</li>
  <li>Confusion or extreme drowsiness</li>
  <li>Very rapid heartbeat</li>
  <li>Unable to speak in full sentences</li>
  <li>High fever with worsening symptoms</li>
</ul>

<h3>Have an Action Plan</h3>
<p>Work with the doctor to create a COPD action plan that specifies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Green zone: Stable symptoms—continue regular medications</li>
  <li>Yellow zone: Warning signs—take specific steps, contact doctor</li>
  <li>Red zone: Emergency—call 911 or go to ER</li>
</ul>

<h2>Nutrition and COPD</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Small, frequent meals:</strong> Large meals can press on diaphragm</li>
  <li><strong>Adequate protein:</strong> For muscle strength</li>
  <li><strong>Limit gas-causing foods:</strong> Beans, cabbage, carbonated drinks</li>
  <li><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Helps thin mucus (unless fluid-restricted)</li>
  <li><strong>Eat slowly:</strong> Avoid rushing and breathlessness</li>
  <li><strong>Rest before meals:</strong> Save energy for eating</li>
</ul>

        question: "Can COPD be cured?",
        answer: "COPD cannot be cured, but it can be managed effectively. Treatment focuses on slowing progression, managing symptoms, preventing exacerbations, and improving quality of life. Quitting smoking is the most important step—it's the only intervention proven to slow COPD progression. With proper management, many people with COPD live active, meaningful lives."
      },
      {
        question: "Is it safe to use oxygen at home?",
        answer: "Yes, oxygen is safe when used correctly. The key safety concern is fire risk—oxygen makes fires burn faster. Never smoke or have open flames near oxygen. Keep away from heat sources. Use water-based products on face (not petroleum-based). Store tanks securely. Have working smoke detectors and post 'Oxygen in Use' signs."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I know if someone with COPD needs emergency care?",
        answer: "Seek emergency care for: severe shortness of breath not relieved by medications, blue or gray lips or fingernails, confusion or extreme drowsiness, very rapid heartbeat, inability to speak in full sentences, or high fever with worsening symptoms. When in doubt, call 911 or seek emergency care."
      },
      {
        question: "Why do people with COPD often lose weight?",
        answer: "COPD can cause weight loss for several reasons: the work of breathing burns extra calories, breathlessness makes eating difficult, fatigue reduces appetite, and some medications affect appetite. Unintended weight loss is concerning because muscle loss weakens breathing muscles. Small, frequent, nutrient-dense meals and supplemental nutrition may help."

  <li>Let them control what's used</li>
  <li>Frame as helping you worry less</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technology + Human Care</h2>
<p>Technology enhances but doesn't replace human care. The best approach combines technology with <a href="/services">professional home care</a> for comprehensive support.</p>

<p><a href="/contact">Contact PrivateInHomeCareGiver</a> to discuss how our caregivers work alongside technology to keep your loved one safe. Call <strong>(617) 555-CARE</strong> or <a href="/contact">schedule a consultation</a>.</p>`,
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "Are medical alert systems worth the cost?",
        answer: "For seniors at risk of falls or medical emergencies who live alone or spend time alone, medical alert systems are often worthwhile. They provide peace of mind and rapid emergency response—potentially life-saving during falls, heart attacks, or strokes. Consider the cost against the potential consequences of a delayed emergency response."
      },
      {
        question: "What if my parent refuses to wear a medical alert device?",
        answer: "This is common. Try addressing their specific objections—if they don't like the appearance, look for smartwatch-style devices. If they feel they don't need it, explain it's for your peace of mind. Emphasize independence: 'This helps you stay home safely.' Consider automatic fall detection systems that work without button pressing. Sometimes having their doctor recommend it helps."
      },
      {
        question: "Can technology replace in-home caregivers?",
        answer: "Technology can supplement but not replace human caregivers. Technology monitors, reminds, and summons help—but cannot assist with bathing, prepare meals, provide companionship, or make judgment calls. The best approach often combines technology (for safety monitoring and communication) with in-home care (for hands-on assistance and human connection)."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I choose between all the technology options?",
        answer: "Start by identifying the most pressing safety or care concern. If it's fall risk, prioritize a medical alert system with fall detection. If it's medication errors, focus on a pill dispenser. If it's isolation, prioritize communication technology. Don't try to implement everything at once—start with one or two solutions that address the biggest concerns, then add more as needed."

<h2>What Are Advance Directives?</h2>

<p>Advance directives are legal documents that communicate your healthcare preferences for situations when you cannot speak for yourself. They take effect only when you're unable to make or communicate decisions—typically due to unconsciousness, severe illness, or advanced dementia.</p>

<h3>Types of Advance Directives</h3>

  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Healthcare Proxy</h2>

<p>A <a href="/articles/healthcare-proxy-massachusetts-guide">Healthcare Proxy</a> names someone to make medical decisions when you cannot. This is the most important advance directive because it ensures someone who knows your values can respond to situations you couldn't anticipate.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts, this is a simple form requiring your signature and two witnesses.</p>

<h2>Living Will</h2>

<p>A living will states your specific wishes about medical treatment at the end of life. Unlike a healthcare proxy (which names who decides), a living will states what you want.</p>

<h3>What a Living Will Addresses</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>CPR:</strong> Do you want attempts to restart your heart?</li>
  <li><strong>Mechanical ventilation:</strong> Do you want a breathing machine?</li>
  <li><strong>Artificial nutrition/hydration:</strong> Feeding tubes, IV fluids?</li>
  <li><strong>Dialysis:</strong> Machine to filter blood if kidneys fail?</li>
  <li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong> Treatment for infections in terminal illness?</li>
  <li><strong>Comfort care:</strong> Pain management and comfort measures?</li>
  <li><strong>Organ donation:</strong> Your wishes about donating organs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations of Living Wills</h3>
<p>Living wills cannot anticipate every situation. That's why having both a living will AND a healthcare proxy is important—the proxy can make decisions about situations you didn't foresee.</p>

<h2>Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Orders</h2>

<p>A DNR order instructs medical personnel not to perform CPR if your heart stops beating or you stop breathing. Unlike advance directives you create yourself, a DNR is a medical order that must be signed by a doctor.</p>

<h3>Understanding CPR</h3>
<p>It's important to understand what CPR involves:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chest compressions (often breaking ribs)</li>
  <li>Electric shocks (defibrillation)</li>
  <li>Breathing tube inserted down throat</li>
  <li>Medications</li>
</ul>

<p>In elderly or seriously ill patients, CPR often doesn't work—and when it does, the person may not return to their previous quality of life. Discuss with your doctor whether CPR aligns with your goals.</p>

<h3>Types of DNR</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>In-hospital DNR:</strong> Only applies in the hospital</li>
  <li><strong>Out-of-hospital DNR:</strong> Applies at home or in the community—EMS will follow it</li>
</ul>

<h2>MOLST/POLST</h2>

<p>Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) in Massachusetts (called POLST in some states) is a medical order form for patients with serious, advanced illness. Unlike advance directives, MOLST:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is a medical order, not just a statement of wishes</li>
  <li>Is signed by both patient/proxy and a clinician</li>
  <li>Is immediately actionable by medical personnel</li>
  <li>Travels with the patient between care settings</li>
  <li>Covers more than just CPR (IV fluids, antibiotics, hospitalization)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who Should Have MOLST?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>People with advanced, life-limiting illness</li>
  <li>Frail elderly who might not survive aggressive treatment</li>
  <li>Anyone for whom death within a year would not be surprising</li>
</ul>

  <figcaption>MOLST is completed through conversation between patient, family, and clinician.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>How to Create Your Advance Directives</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Reflect on Your Values</h3>
<p>Think about what matters most to you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What makes life worth living for you?</li>
  <li>What would you consider an acceptable quality of life?</li>
  <li>How do you feel about depending on machines or others?</li>
  <li>Are there conditions under which you'd want treatment stopped?</li>
  <li>What are your spiritual or religious beliefs about end of life?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Talk to Your Doctor</h3>
<p>Your doctor can explain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your current health situation and prognosis</li>
  <li>What various treatments actually involve</li>
  <li>What's realistic given your condition</li>
  <li>Help you complete MOLST if appropriate</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Talk to Your Family</h3>
<p>Share your wishes with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your healthcare proxy/agent</li>
  <li>Close family members</li>
  <li>Anyone who might be involved in your care</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 4: Complete the Documents</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Healthcare Proxy:</strong> Massachusetts form, two witnesses</li>
  <li><strong>Living Will:</strong> Written statement of wishes (can be informal or formal template)</li>
  <li><strong>MOLST:</strong> With your doctor, if appropriate for your situation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 5: Distribute Copies</h3>
<p>Give copies to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your healthcare proxy/agent</li>
  <li>Your doctor(s)</li>
  <li>Your hospital (for their records)</li>
  <li>Close family members</li>
  <li>Keep originals somewhere accessible</li>
</ul>

<h2>Updating Your Advance Directives</h2>
<p>Review and update when:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your health changes significantly</li>
  <li>Your wishes change</li>
  <li>Your healthcare proxy can no longer serve</li>
  <li>You move to a new state (requirements vary)</li>
  <li>Periodically (every few years) to confirm they still reflect your wishes</li>
</ul>

<h2>For Caregivers: When Your Loved One Has Advance Directives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Know where the documents are kept</li>
  <li>Ensure copies are with doctors and hospitals</li>
  <li>Understand what the documents say</li>
  <li>Know who the healthcare proxy is</li>
  <li>Respect their wishes even if you disagree</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Don't wait for a crisis. Complete your advance directives while you're healthy and thinking clearly. Have the conversations with your loved ones now.</p>

    faqs: [
      {
        question: "Are advance directives legally binding?",
        answer: "Yes, properly executed advance directives are legally binding. Healthcare providers are required to follow them. However, they only apply when you cannot make decisions yourself, and they must be properly witnessed/notarized according to state requirements. Keep copies accessible so providers can find them when needed."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between a living will and MOLST?",
        answer: "A living will is a document you create expressing your wishes—it guides decision-makers but isn't a medical order. MOLST is a medical order signed by both you (or your proxy) and a clinician. Emergency responders and healthcare providers must follow MOLST as they would any other medical order. MOLST is for seriously ill patients; living wills are for anyone."
      },
      {
        question: "If I have a DNR, will I still receive medical treatment?",
        answer: "Absolutely. A DNR only applies to CPR if your heart stops. You will still receive all other appropriate medical treatment—medications, surgery, hospital care, etc. A DNR doesn't mean 'do not treat'—it means 'if my heart stops, don't try to restart it.' All other care continues as appropriate."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I change my mind about my advance directives?",
        answer: "Yes, you can change or revoke your advance directives at any time, as long as you're mentally competent. Simply create new documents (which automatically revoke old ones), or clearly destroy old copies and communicate changes to your healthcare proxy, family, and medical providers."
