"properly upgrade" your list of facility names into a reliable, data-rich dataset (with real addresses, phone numbers, map links, and user reviews), the most professional and reliable method is using the Google Places API (New Version).

Standard scraping is unreliable on Replit due to captchas. The API guarantees you get the correct googleMapsUri and real-time reviews.

Here is the strategy to upgrade your 1,000+ facilities before you generate the articles.

Phase 1: The "Data Enrichment" Prompt
This prompt instructs the Replit Agent to build a script that takes your list of names, finds them on Google Maps, and downloads all the missing metadata into a structured JSON file.

Copy/Paste this into Replit Agent:

Role: Senior Data Engineer & API Specialist.

Objective: Create a Node.js script to "enrich" a list of Massachusetts nursing facility names with real-time data from the Google Places API (New Version).

Input Data:

Read from facilities.txt (A line-separated list of facility names).

API Integration:

Use the Google Places API (New) endpoint: https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText

Authentication: Use dotenv for GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY.

Field Masking (Crucial for Cost/Speed): Only request these specific fields:

places.formattedAddress

places.nationalPhoneNumber

places.rating

places.userRatingCount

places.googleMapsUri (The direct link to the map)

places.reviews (Get the top 3 most relevant reviews)

places.websiteUri

Logic & Flow:

Concurrency: Use p-limit (set to 10) to process the list quickly but within API rate limits.

Search Logic: Send the facility name + "Nursing Home Massachusetts" as the text query to ensure accuracy.

Validation: If the API returns no results, log it to not_found.txt so I can fix the name manually.

Output: Save the successful results to enriched_facilities.json.

Structure: The JSON should be an array of objects where each object combines the original name with the new API data.

Sample Output Structure:

JSON

[
  {
    "originalName": "Example Manor",
    "address": "123 Main St, Boston, MA",
    "phone": "(617) 555-0199",
    "mapsLink": "https://maps.google.com/...",
    "rating": 4.5,
    "reviews": [ ... ],
    "reviewCount": 120
  }
]
Execution: Install axios, dotenv, and p-limit. Scaffold the script.

Phase 2: Execution Steps (Crucial for Reliability)
1. Get the Google Maps API Key
You cannot skip this if you want "totally reliable" data.

Go to the Google Cloud Console.

Create a project and enable "Places API (New)".

Create an API Key.

Cost Warning: This costs approximately $15–$30 per 1,000 facilities depending on how much data (reviews/photos) you request. This is the price of clean, reliable data.

2. Run the Enrichment Script
Put your list of names in facilities.txt.

Add your API Key to Replit Secrets (GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY).

Run the script.

You will end up with enriched_facilities.json. This is your "Golden Dataset."

Phase 3: Generating the "Upgraded" Articles
Now that you have enriched_facilities.json, you need to update the Article Generation Prompt (from the previous chat) to use this rich data instead of just raw names.

Update your Article Gen Prompt with this:

"Instead of reading topics.txt, read enriched_facilities.json.

When generating the article for each facility:

Header: Display the Facility Name and the address and phone immediately under the title.

CTA Button: Create a button labeled 'View on Google Maps' linked to mapsLink.

Social Proof: Create a 'Reviews & Ratings' section. Display the rating (e.g., 4.5/5 stars) and quote the top 2 reviews provided in the JSON data.

SEO Schema: Inject this specific data into a 'LocalBusiness' JSON-LD schema in the <head>."
