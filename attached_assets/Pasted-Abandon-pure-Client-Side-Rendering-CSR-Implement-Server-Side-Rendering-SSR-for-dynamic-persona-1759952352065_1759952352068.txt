Abandon pure Client-Side Rendering (CSR). Implement Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for dynamic, personalized content, and Static Site Generation (SSG) or Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for static or low-frequency content (e.g., landing pages, blogs). This ensures search engines receive a fully rendered HTML page instantly.	
SSR for Metadata Delivery	Ensure all critical SEO elements (titles, descriptions, canonicals) are injected and present in the initial HTML response from the server, not rendered client-side.	
II. Dynamic Metadata (On-Page SEO)	Dynamic Head Management	Use a library like react-helmet-async (or the meta-framework's native solution) to manage the <head> of the document dynamically for every route.	
Canonical URL Implementation	Set a unique and server-rendered <link rel="canonical"> tag for every indexable page to prevent duplicate content issues and consolidate link equity.	
Structured Data Markup	Implement JSON-LD (<script type="application/ld+json">) dynamically, delivered server-side, for Rich Results eligibility (e.g., Product Schema, FAQ Schema). Tools like react-schemaorg can facilitate this.	
Social Media Optimization (SMO)	Implement Open Graph (og:) and Twitter Card metadata tags dynamically using the Head Management solution to control social media link previews and maximize Click-Through Rate (CTR).	
III. Performance Optimization (Core Web Vitals)	Code Splitting and Lazy Loading	Aggressively implement route-based code splitting (e.g., React.lazy and Suspense) to reduce the main JavaScript bundle size, minimizing main thread blocking and improving First Input Delay (FID)/Interaction to Next Paint (INP).	
Image Optimization and LCP	Optimize all images using modern formats (WebP/AVIF), and ensure all critical, Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) contributing images are preloaded (<link rel="preload">). Lazy load non-critical images.	
Layout Shift Prevention (CLS)	Specify explicit width and height dimensions or use CSS aspect-ratio for all media (images/videos) to prevent unexpected layout shifts during load.	
CDN and TTFB	Utilize a high-performance Content Delivery Network (CDN) universally to serve static assets and cached SSG pages to minimize Time to First Byte (TTFB).	
IV. Crawlability and Indexing	XML Sitemaps	Implement dynamic generation of XML Sitemaps during the build process to list all indexable URLs and notify search engines of new or updated content quickly.	
robots.txt Configuration	Place a robots.txt file in the root directory to manage Googlebotâ€™s crawl budget, allowing access to essential content while disallowing low-value or private pages (e.g., admin panels).	
Redirects and 404 Pages	Implement server-side 301 redirects for permanently moved URLs to preserve link equity, and ensure a functional, branded custom 404 page is in place for unmatched routes.	
Internal Linking and UX	Establish a clear, logical navigation structure and use descriptive anchor text for internal links to aid content discovery and distribute link equity effectively.	
V. Tracking and Validation	Google Tag Manager (GTM) for SPA	Implement GTM initialization early in the app lifecycle and configure a History Change Trigger within the GTM console. This is essential for tracking client-side route changes as virtual page views, ensuring accurate analytics for SEO and SEM campaigns.	
Google Search Console (GSC) Verification	Verify site ownership on Google Search Console immediately. Use the URL Inspection Tool routinely to verify that Googlebot successfully crawls and renders the page (checking the rendered HTML and loaded resources list).
