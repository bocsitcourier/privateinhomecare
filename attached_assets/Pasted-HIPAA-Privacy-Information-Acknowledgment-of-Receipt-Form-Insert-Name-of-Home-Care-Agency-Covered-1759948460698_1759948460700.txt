Right to Amend: The right to request an amendment if they believe the record is inaccurate or incomplete.    

Right to Request Restrictions: The right to request limits on how PHI is used or shared. Crucially, this must highlight the mandatory restriction right to restrict disclosure to a health plan if the client pays for the service in full, out-of-pocket.    

Right to Confidential Communications: The right to request communication be sent to a specific location or by a specific method.    

Right to an Accounting of Disclosures: The right to receive a list of certain disclosures made by the agency.

Agency Duties and Legal Obligations: A statement confirming the agency's commitment to maintaining PHI privacy and security, and the duty to notify the individual promptly following a breach.    

Complaint Procedure: Clear instructions on how to file a complaint, including the name/title and contact details (phone number) of the internal Privacy Officer for the agency. It must also include contact information for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR), as the external enforcement body.    

Non-Retaliation Clause: A statement assuring the client that they will not face retaliation for filing a complaint.
