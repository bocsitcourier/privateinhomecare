Webpage Design: Share Peace of Mind (Client Referral Program)
The creation of a high-conversion client referral page for privateinhomecare requires an empathetic, trust-based design that aligns the financial incentive with the family’s need for peace of mind. The design must be simple, mobile-responsive, and prominently feature the dual, compliant incentive structure.

Page Title: Share Peace of Mind: Refer a Family, Receive a $300 Service Credit.
URL: /refer-a-friend or /share-peace-of-mind
Design Style: Warm, modern, professional. Use high-quality, authentic imagery of caregivers and seniors engaged in companionship or light support tasks. Use a clear, three-step process flow.   

SECTION 1: THE CORE MESSAGE (Above the Fold)
Headline: Trusted Care Deserves to Be Shared.
Sub-Headline: Share the peace of mind you found with privateinhomecare and get rewarded for your loyalty.
Body Copy (Empathetic Connection):
You know better than anyone the immense emotional weight of coordinating care—the worry, the exhaustion, and the profound relief that comes from finding a truly compassionate and professional partner. We are deeply grateful for your trust in our team and for giving us the highest honor: caring for your loved one. Now, help another family find that same peace of mind.

SECTION 4: TRANSPARENCY & COMPLIANCE (The Legal Safeguard)
Headline: Our Commitment to Ethical Practice.

As a reputable private-pay home care provider, privateinhomecare adheres strictly to all state and federal anti-kickback statutes. To maintain compliance and protect your interests, the financial incentive provided ($300 Service Credit) is explicitly designated for non-medical, private-pay Companion Care or IADL assistance only. It is not a cash payment and cannot be applied toward services covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or long-term care insurance. This ensures we uphold the highest standards of integrity in generating new business.
