Harden & Secure Our React Site for Production
1. Enforce HTTPS
Host the site on servers with HTTPS enabled. Obtain and install a valid SSL/TLS certificate.

Ensure all traffic is redirected from HTTP to HTTPS at both the server and CDN level.

Validate using SSL Labs: confirm an “A” grade and strong cipher suites.

2. Update Dependencies
Run npm audit and yarn audit to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

Update React, React DOM, and all packages to their latest stable versions.

Set up Snyk or Dependabot for ongoing vulnerability monitoring.

3. Input Validation & Sanitization
Validate and sanitize all user input client-side using validator.js or similar libraries.

Sanitize server-side inputs as well; never rely solely on frontend checks.

If using dangerouslySetInnerHTML, rigorously sanitize with DOMPurify.

4. Prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
Avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML unless strictly necessary—sanitize all such content.

Only use React JSX variable interpolation ({}) for dynamic values (auto-escaped).

Properly escape < and > when injecting data into SSR hydration.

5. Secure Authentication & Authorization
Implement backend-validated token authentication (JWT, OAuth2).

Store tokens in HTTP-only cookies, never in localStorage.

Apply server-side checks for user roles/permissions.

Enable MFA for admin or privileged actions.

6. Secure APIs & Communication
Ensure all API endpoints are HTTPS-only.

Set strict CORS; explicitly whitelist acceptable origins.

Apply rate limiting to critical endpoints.

7. Mitigate CSRF
Use SameSite cookies for session authentication.

Add CSRF tokens for form and API submissions as needed.

8. Harden HTTP Headers
Set these headers at the server or CDN:

X-Frame-Options: DENY

X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block

Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade

Strict-Transport-Security enabled.

9. Secure File Uploads
Whitelist allowed file types on backend.

Scan uploaded files for malware.

Refuse archives (.zip, .tar) unless strictly required.

10. Protect Secrets & API Keys
Never expose secrets, API keys, or credentials in the frontend bundle.

Store sensitive keys server-side—fetch them securely via authenticated APIs.

11. Audit Third-Party Scripts
Vet all third-party scripts for security; prefer official sources.

Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for externally loaded scripts/styles.

12. Set Content Security Policy (CSP)
Implement a restrictive CSP to block inline scripts and untrusted sources.

13. Monitor & Test Regularly
Integrate Sentry for client error monitoring.

Set up server-side monitoring, anomaly alerts, and regular pen testing.

14. Encrypt Data in Transit/Storage
Confirm all active data flows use TLS/HTTPS.

For offline/Progressive Web App data, encrypt using browser crypto APIs.

15. Document Security Measures
Document all steps taken, key package choices, header configs, and security policies.

Include secure deployment instructions for future reference.
