PWA Icon Requirements:
====================

For full PWA support, create the following icons and place them in client/public/:

1. pwa-192x192.png - 192x192px icon (required)
2. pwa-512x512.png - 512x512px icon (required)
3. apple-touch-icon.png - 180x180px (for iOS devices)

These icons should feature your brand logo/colors:
- Primary: #8B5CF6 (Purple)
- Background: White or transparent

Tools to create icons:
- Canva: https://canva.com
- Figma: https://figma.com
- PWA Asset Generator: https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator

Until icons are created, the PWA will function but may show default/missing icon placeholders.
